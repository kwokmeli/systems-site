## Setup
Zip the contents of this folder into a compressed folder.

Next, navigate to Appearance -> Themes -> Add New -> Upload Theme, and upload the compressed folder. Activate the theme.

## Page Templates
Pages containing content should use the default page template. The sitemap page should use the 'HTML Sitemap' page template (no extra content needs to be added to the sitemap page).

## Password Protected Pages
To password protect a page, go to Edit Page of the page you want protected. On the right-hand sidebar under Publish, edit the Visibility and select Password protected. All pages that are password protected should use the same password; thus the password only needs to be entered once to see all the pages that use that same password. If the password has not been entered, password protected pages will not show up in the sitemap. However, if the password has been entered, password protected pages will show up in the sitemap.

The current amount of time that the password cookie is kept for is set to default.
